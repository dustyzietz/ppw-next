There were more conversations about the way we are going to do tags and Andy is sticking with using the prismic tags. He wants an estimate so Christina is making a list of all the things that will go into making the change. Here's what we have right now is there anything else you can think of? slice machine (be able to select the tag)
slice code (query by prismic tag)
blog home page - tag cloud updated to use prismic tags
Updating all pages, posts, case studies, people with prismic tags
Archiving all current custom tags
Create tag pages based on prismic tags
